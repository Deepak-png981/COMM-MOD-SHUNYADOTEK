## 5. Data Governance Principles <a name="data-governance-principles"></a>

### 5.1. Data Quality Objectives <a name="data-governance-principles-data-quality-objectives"></a>

To ensure data quality, the following objectives have been established:

- **Data accuracy**: All data must be accurate and up-to-date to maintain the integrity of information within the system.
- **Data completeness**: There should be no missing or incomplete data to ensure that all necessary information is available for decision-making.
- **Data consistency**: Data should be consistent across the system, ensuring uniformity and reliability in reporting and analysis.
- **Data privacy**: User data must be protected in accordance with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and other relevant privacy regulations. User consent and data anonymization will be implemented where necessary to safeguard individual privacy.

### 5.2. Privacy and Security Considerations <a name="data-governance-principles-privacy-and-security-considerations"></a>

Stringent privacy and security measures will be implemented to safeguard user data. The following considerations will be part of the security strategy:

- **Access controls**: Robust access control mechanisms will be in place to manage and restrict user access to sensitive data. Role-based access and permissions will be enforced to ensure that users have access only to the data and functionalities necessary for their roles.
- **Data encryption**: Data in transit and at rest will be encrypted to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Regular audits**: Periodic security audits and reviews will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security standards and best practices.
- **Incident response plan**: An incident response plan will be established to address and mitigate security incidents promptly.
- **Data retention and disposal**: Clear data retention policies will be defined to manage the lifecycle of data, including its secure disposal when it is no longer needed.
- **User education and awareness**: Users will be educated about data privacy and security best practices to promote a culture of awareness and responsibility.

These data governance principles and security considerations are essential for maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within the Entity Record Management System(ERMS). They also demonstrate a commitment to protecting user privacy and complying with relevant data protection regulations.

- **Inventory Management System Integration**: Streamlining inventory management and tracking for projects that involve physical goods.

### 7.2. Preliminary Data Exchange Considerations <a name="integration-and-interoperability-preliminary-data-exchange-considerations"></a>

#### Data Formats

Data exchange between systems will use the following formats:
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
- **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)**: A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: APIs will be RESTful (Representational State Transfer) for ease of integration, allowing external systems to access and interact with the PMS in a standardized and efficient manner.

## 8. Security and Compliance (Overview) <a name="security-and-compliance-overview"></a>

### 8.1. Initial Security Considerations <a name="security-and-compliance-initial-security-considerations"></a>

#### Security Protocols

To ensure the security of the Entity Record Management System (ERMS), the following security protocols and measures will be implemented:

- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to restrict unauthorized access to system resources and data, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions based on their roles.
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard protocols to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception. This includes using encryption mechanisms such as SSL/TLS for data in transit and encryption algorithms for data at rest.

### 8.2. Regulatory Compliance Overview <a name="security-and-compliance-regulatory-compliance-overview"></a>

#### GDPR Compliance

The Entity Record Management System(ERMS) will adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to safeguard user data and privacy. GDPR compliance measures will include:

- **User Consent**: Implementing mechanisms for obtaining user consent for data processing, ensuring transparency in data handling practices.
- **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)**: Conducting DPIAs to assess and mitigate potential risks to data privacy and security in the system.
- **Data Breach Notification Procedures**: Establishing procedures for timely and compliant notification of data breaches to relevant authorities and affected individuals, as required by GDPR.

These integration, interoperability, security, and compliance considerations are vital components of the Entity Record Management System (ERMS) to ensure seamless operation, data security, and adherence to relevant regulations.
